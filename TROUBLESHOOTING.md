# Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## ðŸš¨ "Network Process" Error Solutions

If you're getting a "deployment failed due to network process" error, try these solutions:

### Solution 1: Use the Simplified Dockerfile

1. **Rename the current Dockerfile**:
   ```bash
   mv Dockerfile Dockerfile.complex
   mv Dockerfile.simple Dockerfile
   ```

2. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Use simplified Dockerfile for deployment"
   git push
   ```

3. **Redeploy** on Railway/Render

### Solution 2: Railway-Specific Fixes

#### Option A: Use Railway's Built-in Laravel Support
Instead of Docker, try using Railway's native PHP support:

1. **Delete the Dockerfile** temporarily:
   ```bash
   rm Dockerfile
   ```

2. **Create a `railway.toml` file**:
   ```toml
   [build]
   builder = "nixpacks"
   
   [deploy]
   startCommand = "php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=$PORT"
   healthcheckPath = "/"
   healthcheckTimeout = 300
   ```

3. **Push and redeploy**

#### Option B: Fix Docker Build Issues
If you want to keep using Docker:

1. **Use the updated Dockerfile** (already optimized)
2. **Set these environment variables in Railway**:
   ```
   COMPOSER_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/composer-cache
   COMPOSER_MEMORY_LIMIT=-1
   ```

### Solution 3: Render-Specific Fixes

1. **Use the simplified approach**:
   - Keep the current `render.yaml`
   - The updated configuration should work better

2. **If still failing, try without Docker**:
   - Delete `render.yaml`
   - Use Render's native PHP support
   - Set build command: `composer install --no-dev`
   - Set start command: `php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=$PORT`

### Solution 4: Alternative Deployment Platforms

If Railway and Render keep having network issues, try:

#### Vercel (with PHP support)
```json
{
  "functions": {
    "api/*.php": {
      "runtime": "vercel-php@0.6.0"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Heroku
Create `Procfile`:
```
web: vendor/bin/heroku-php-apache2 public/
```

#### DigitalOcean App Platform
Use the simplified Dockerfile approach.

## ðŸ”§ Common Network Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Composer Timeout
**Symptoms**: Build fails during `composer install`
**Fix**: 
- Use `--prefer-dist` flag
- Set `COMPOSER_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/composer-cache`
- Increase timeout in platform settings

### Issue 2: Docker Build Context Too Large
**Symptoms**: Build fails with "context too large" error
**Fix**:
- Add `.dockerignore` file:
  ```
  node_modules
  vendor
  .git
  storage/logs
  ```

### Issue 3: Platform Rate Limiting
**Symptoms**: Intermittent network failures
**Fix**:
- Wait 10-15 minutes between deployments
- Use different deployment times
- Try during off-peak hours

## ðŸš€ Quick Deployment Commands

### For Railway (with simplified Dockerfile):
```bash
# Use the simple Dockerfile
mv Dockerfile.simple Dockerfile

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Fix deployment with simplified Dockerfile"
git push origin main
```

### For Render (current setup should work):
```bash
# Just push - render.yaml is already optimized
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy roulette game"
git push origin main
```

## ðŸ“Š Platform Comparison

| Platform | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| **Railway** | Fast, easy setup | Sometimes network issues | Quick deployments |
| **Render** | Reliable, good free tier | Slower cold starts | Production apps |
| **Vercel** | Excellent performance | Limited PHP support | Static + API |
| **Heroku** | Mature platform | Expensive after free tier | Enterprise apps |

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Approach

1. **Try Railway first** with the simplified Dockerfile
2. **If Railway fails**, try Render with the current setup
3. **If both fail**, try Railway without Docker (native PHP)
4. **Last resort**: Use Heroku or DigitalOcean

## ðŸ“ž Getting Help

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check platform logs** in Railway/Render dashboard
2. **Try deploying during off-peak hours** (late night/early morning)
3. **Use a different region** if available
4. **Contact platform support** with specific error messages

The simplified Dockerfile should resolve most network process issues! ðŸš€
