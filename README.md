## Usage

### ðŸŽ¯ Custom Winner Feature

The game includes a powerful custom winner feature that allows you to set a guaranteed winner:

#### **Setting a Custom Winner**

2. **Enter Winner Name**: Type the exact name that should always win
3. **Enable Feature**: Check the "Enable Custom Winner" checkbox
4. **Save Settings**: Click "Save Settings" to activate

#### **How It Works**

- **Guaranteed Win**: If the custom winner name is in the player list, they will win 100% of the time
- **Auto-Clear**: Custom winner is automatically cleared after they win (prevents repeat wins)
- **Random Fallback**: If the custom winner is not in the player list, the game uses normal random selection
- **Real-time Changes**: You can change the winner name anytime without restarting the game
- **No Sessions**: Uses persistent config files, so settings survive server restarts

#### **Managing Custom Winner**

- **Change Winner**: Visit `/custom-winner` to modify the winner name
- **Disable Feature**: Uncheck "Enable Custom Winner" to return to random selection
- **Clear Settings**: Use "Clear Winner" to remove all custom winner settings
- **Status Check**: The settings page shows current winner name and status

#### **Example Usage**

1. Set custom winner to "John"
2. Add players: "Alice", "Bob", "John", "Charlie"
3. Spin the wheel â†’ "John" will always win
4. Change players to: "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie" (no "John")
5. Spin the wheel â†’ Random selection from Alice, Bob, Charlie
